# Customer Segmentation for Cross-selling Opportunities

## Project Description
The study of segmentation focuses on applying segmentation techniques to analyze customer purchase patterns and identify cross-selling opportunities. In this project, we collected information about the types of oil products sold by customers and their weekly purchase quantities and other relevant details. With this information, we created detailed customer profiles and identified common patterns in their buying behavior.

## Project Components
- Data Collection: Information about the types of oil products sold by customers and their weekly purchase quantities were collected.
- Data Preprocessing: The collected data was processed and cleaned to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.
- Customer Segmentation: Python was used to perform customer segmentation based on their purchase patterns. 
- Cross-selling Analysis: Based on the identified customer segments, the project may have performed an analysis to identify potential cross-selling opportunities between different categories of oil products.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed data used in the project.
- `scripts/`: Includes the Python scripts used for data preprocessing and customer segmentation.
- `XLSX_files_output/`: Contains the output files of each score.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies for Python (e.g., pandas, numpy) by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script in the `scripts/` directory to explore the data preprocessing and segmentation code.
4. Analyze the customer segments and identify potential cross-selling opportunities based on the visualizations and analysis results.

## Requirements
The following dependencies are required to run the code:
- Python (version 8.9.0)

Please ensure that you have the specified versions of these dependencies or later versions installed for smooth execution.
